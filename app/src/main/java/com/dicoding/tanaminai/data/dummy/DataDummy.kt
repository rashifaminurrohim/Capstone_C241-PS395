Many mail-order nurseries sell them as bare roots. Before you plant, cut the existing roots back to 6 inches; this will encourage feeder roots to grow near the trunk. Soak bare-root plants in a bucket of water for three to four hours before planting. At planting, remove all canes except the most vigorous one. The planting hole should be about 12 inches deep and 12 inches wide. Add 4 inches of soil in the center of the hole and set the bare-root vine on top. Fill in the rest of the hole with the remaining soil, making sure to keep the soil level below the graft (the swollen area of the main stem). Water immediately after planting.\n" +

                    "\n" +
                    "On a vertical trellis, you will select branches from the previous year's growth to grow along the support wires. The buds along the stems will flower and set fruit. The trellis can have two or three levels, and the center stem is left to grow up to the next level. If you'd like the grapes to hang overhead from an arbor, train the vines to grow that way. You'll still shorten the branches and select a few to secure to the metal or wood arbor.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Allow the grapes to grow to the top of the support in the first year, and remove the top of the cane to force it to grow laterally (parallel to the ground) from there."
